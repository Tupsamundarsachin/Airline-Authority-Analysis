# Airline-Authority-Analysis
This project involves analyzing airline performance and its impact on passengers using a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of airline operations, including flight status, delays, and the overall effect on passenger experience.

Problem Statement:
Airline performance significantly affects passenger experience and satisfaction. Understanding flight statuses, delays, and their impact can help airlines improve their operations and enhance customer service. This project aims to address the following questions:
1. What are the performance metrics of different airlines, including canceled, delayed, and on-time flights?
2. How does the average delay time in flights vary per day and per year?
3. What is the overall impact of flight delays and cancellations on passengers?


APPROACH:
To solve these problems, the following approach was taken:

1. Data Collection: Gathered comprehensive data on airlines, including flight statuses (canceled, delayed, and on-time) and delay times.

2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy, handling any inconsistencies or missing values.

3. Dashboard Creation: Developed a Power BI dashboard with the following features:
   a) Airline Names: Listed all airlines included in the dataset, providing a basis for further analysis.
   b) Flight Status Analysis: Visualized the number of canceled, delayed, and on-time flights for each airline, helping to assess performance.  
   c) Average Delay Time: Displayed average delay times per day and per year, offering insights into trends and patterns.
   d) Passenger Impact: Analyzed how flight delays and cancellations affect passenger experience, including potential delays in travel plans and overall inconvenience.


4. Trend Analysis: 
   a) Comparative Analysis: Compared performance metrics between different airlines to highlight areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement.
   b) Insights and Recommendations: Provided actionable insights based on the data analysis, suggesting ways airlines could improve their operations and reduce the impact on passengers.

CONCLUSION:
The Airline Authority Analysis Dashboard offers a detailed view of airline performance, focusing on flight statuses, delays, and their impact on passengers. By visualizing key metrics and trends, the dashboard helps airlines identify performance issues, understand passenger impacts, and make informed decisions to enhance service quality. This project underscores the importance of data analysis in optimizing airline operations and improving passenger satisfaction.
