# Airline-Authority-Analysis
This project involves analyzing airline performance and its impact on passengers using a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of airline operations, including flight status, delays, and the overall effect on passenger experience.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Airline performance significantly affects passenger experience and satisfaction. Understanding flight statuses, delays, and their impact can help airlines improve their operations and enhance customer service. This project aims to address the following questions:
1. What are the performance metrics of different airlines, including canceled, delayed, and on-time flights?
2. How does the average delay time in flights vary per day and year?
3. What is the overall impact of flight delays and cancellations on passengers?


APPROACH:
To solve these problems, the following approach was taken:
1. Data Collection: Gathered comprehensive data on airlines, including flight statuses (canceled, delayed, and on-time) and delay times.
2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy, handling any inconsistencies or missing values.
3. Dashboard Creation: Developed a Power BI dashboard with the following features:
   a) Airline Names: Listed all airlines included in the dataset, providing a basis for further analysis.
   b) Flight Status Analysis: Visualized the number of canceled, delayed, and on-time flights for each airline, helping to assess performance.  
   c) Average Delay Time: Displayed average delay times per day and per year, offering insights into trends and patterns.
   d) Passenger Impact: Analyzed how flight delays and cancellations affect passenger experience, including potential delays in travel plans and overall inconvenience.
